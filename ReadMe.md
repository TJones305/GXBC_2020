Future Additions:
Due to outside influences I found myself trimming my initial plan down. I have plans to add these in the future, however felt that they weren't paramount to the site meeting it's needs.
Below is the code I had constructed for the icons to these pages in preparation.        
        <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
        <a href="competition.html"><i class="fa fa-trophy" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| Play Bowls |</span></a>
        </li>
        <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
        <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| About Us  |</span></a>
        </li>
        <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
        <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-medal" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| Honours |</span></a>
        </li>

Responsive Design for devices at approx. 600px width will need to be addressed in the future.

Other Functionality for future update:
Live Score function - A request from Gerrard's Cross Bowls Club was to have a function where they could add the score of a group of matches and it update on the index page of the site as a breaking news story. I felt that while it would be a useful feature, I don't currently have 
the knowledge required to make this possible, however I do believe that this is a possible feature to add in the future.

Link with myClubhouse - Gerrard's Cross Bowls Club have a second site which is aimed at current members and requires credentials to access. On the myClubhouse site members can currently access membership options, submit competition entries & payment for both forementioned. 
It is the club's wish that the sign in functionality is embedded in the member's section instead of a button which links to the site. Similarly to the Live score function I belive this is a possibility in the future, however at this point in time I haven't the knowledge required
for this task, however I plan to return in the future once I have this knowledge and add the function to the site.
