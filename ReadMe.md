         Additions in the future
        Due to outside influences I found myself trimming my initial plan down. I have plans to add these in the future, however felt that they weren't paramount to the site meeting it's needs.
        Below is the code I had constructed for the icons to these pages in preparation.        
                            <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
                                <a href="competition.html"><i class="fa fa-trophy" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| Play Bowls |</span></a>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
                                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| About Us  |</span></a>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-inline-item menubar-color menuitem">
                                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-medal" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>| Honours |</span></a>
                            </li>

        Other features I would like to add in the future are:
        Live Google Maps facility - The purpose of this is for those who are travelling to Gerrards Cross Bowls from other bowls clubs in the country are able to plan their journey from the club site with Gerrard's Cross as the "anchor point" for the directions function.
        Given the club's success at national and international level this would have have a useful place on the website and increase the site's efficiency.

        Live Score function - A request from Gerrard's Cross Bowls Club was to have a function where they could add the score of a group of matches and it update on the index page of the site as a breaking news story. I felt that while it would be a useful feature, I don't currently have
        the knowledge required to make this possible, however I do believe that this is a possible feature to add in the future.

        Link with myClubhouse - Gerrard's Cross Bowls Club have a second site which is aimed at current members and requires credentials to access. On the myClubhouse site members can currently access membership options, submit competition entries & payment for both forementioned. 
        It is the club's wish that the sign in functionality is imbedded in the member's section instead of a button which links to the site. Similarly to the Live score function I belive this is a possibility in the future, however at this point in time I haven't the knowledge required
        for this task, however I plan to return in the future once I have this knowledge and add the function to the site.
